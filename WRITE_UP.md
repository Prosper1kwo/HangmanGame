# WRITE-UP
## Motivation for project (Jowayne)
When I was younger and didn’t know much about computers or the world for that matter, I used to play  simple computer games with my younger siblings and cousins. This game was called 'hangaroo'. The premise was simple, a kangaroo is being hung/hanged by some evil force and it was your job, the player to save him by guessing the word or phrase through a simple hint. I remember enjoying this game as the kangaroo’s response was so sassy and it slowly urged me to try better to save it or it would severly burn causing me to guess wrong on purpose. As a CS student, I wanted to create a basic replica of this game which is the major motivation for creating hangman.

## Challenges faced on the project (Prosper)
While writing this code, I and Jowayne encountered lots of problems. From arguments concerning what codes should be implemented and how it should be run, to spending more than a day trying to figure out how to write a code to overcome a specific task. Our modes of thinking were different, just as there are different ways to write a code; Jowayne is very direct, while I am much more verbose. We had to look for a way to work together better, and we did by becoming more accepting of each other's view point and improving it by making respectful suggestions, which was way more efficient.

Another challenge was writing codes like the decode_function, where we spent more than a week for just a single line of code. We were able to do this by researching different ways to replace, slice and so on and were able to come across just the perfect solution to that. The sound implementation was also another challenge, but we had help from a student during the show-case in class.

## Core funcionality of final results (Jowayne and Prosper)
The final results is a more comprehensive and true to life version of the the Minimum Value Product. Unlike the minimum value product that only accepted a single word, The final result accepted phrases and spaced words as well as implemented a single player mode. Finally, the final result also included audio files.
