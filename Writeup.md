## Motivation for project
When I was younger and didn’t know much about computers or the world for that mater, I used to play  simple computer game with my younger siblings and cousins. This game was called hangaroo. The premise was simple, a kangaroo is being hanged by some evil force and it was your job, the player to save him by guessing the word or phrase through a simple hint. I remembered enjoying this game as the kangaroo’s response was so sassy and it slowly urged me to try better to save it or it would severly burn causing ,e to guess wrong on purpose. As a CS student, I wanted to created a basic replica of this game which is why I created hangman
